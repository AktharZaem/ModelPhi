üé£ WHAT IS PHISHING?
Think of phishing like a fisherman trying to catch fish with fake bait. Scammers send fake emails pretending to be from banks, companies, or people you know to "catch" your personal information.

üö® WHAT TO DO:
‚Ä¢ NEVER reply with personal details like passwords, credit card numbers, or social security numbers
‚Ä¢ Don't click suspicious links or attachments
‚Ä¢ If it seems urgent or scary, it's probably fake
‚Ä¢ When in doubt, contact the company directly using their official website or phone number

üí° SIMPLE RULE: Real companies will NEVER ask for passwords or personal details via email!

üîí UNDERSTANDING PHISHING ATTACKS:
Phishing emails are designed to steal your personal information by impersonating legitimate organizations or creating a sense of urgency.

üõ°Ô∏è BEST PRACTICES:
‚Ä¢ Always verify the sender's email address carefully
‚Ä¢ Look for spelling and grammar mistakes in the email
‚Ä¢ Check if the email uses generic greetings like "Dear Customer"
‚Ä¢ Hover over links without clicking to see the real destination
‚Ä¢ Use two-factor authentication on important accounts

‚öñÔ∏è VERIFICATION: When suspicious, independently verify by contacting the organization through official channels

üéØ ADVANCED PHISHING DEFENSE:
Implementing comprehensive anti-phishing strategies requires understanding attack vectors and implementing layered security controls.

üî¨ ENTERPRISE CONSIDERATIONS:
‚Ä¢ Deploy email security gateways with advanced threat protection
‚Ä¢ Implement DMARC, SPF, and DKIM email authentication protocols
‚Ä¢ Conduct regular phishing simulation training
‚Ä¢ Monitor and analyze email headers for authentication failures
‚Ä¢ Establish incident response procedures for phishing attacks
